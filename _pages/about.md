I'm currently fostering my love for computing at Clemson University. I am in pursuit of my Master of Science in Computer Science degree.

My area of focus is Informatics and Scientific Computation. I'm captivated by data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cyber security. Interested in what I've done? Look [here!][projects]

I graduated from Clemson University with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in May of 2017. You can find my full resume [here.][resume]

When I'm not programming, you can find me exploring the great outdoors. I relish any activity that brings me outside including backpacking, mountain biking, kayaking, and camping! Check out some of my adventures [here!][adventures]
