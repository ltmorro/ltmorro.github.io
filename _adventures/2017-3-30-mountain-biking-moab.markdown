This page is still a work in progress.

A little-known gem at Clemson University is [CORE][CORE]. CORE organizes amazing trips, offers workshops teaching outdoor skills, and provides excellent rental equipment for university students. I took a leap of faith for spring break and decided to sign up for their mountain biking trip to [Moab, Utah][Moab]. Prior to the trip, you could say my mountain biking experience was lacking...I had never ridden a mountain bike on anything that would be considered an official trail. Moab is known for having some of the best and most difficult mountain biking trails in the world, so I was banking on being a quick study.
