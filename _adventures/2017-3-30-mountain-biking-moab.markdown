This page is still a work in progress.

A little-known gem at Clemson University is [CORE][CORE]. CORE organizes amazing trips, offers workshops teaching outdoor skills, and provides excellent rental equipment for university students. I took a leap of faith for spring break and decided to sign up for their mountain biking trip to [Moab, Utah][Moab]. Prior to the trip, you could say my mountain biking experience was lacking...I had never ridden a mountain bike on anything that would be considered an official trail. Moab is known for having some of the best and most difficult mountain biking trails in the world, so I was banking on being a quick study.

## Mountain Biking Trails
We had 5 days to mountain bike and we weren't going to waste any of it. We hit 5 different trails and had a blast riding them.
### Moab Brand Trails

### Porcupine Rim
The Whole Enchilada is a world famous mountain biking trail that takes riders down from the alpine peak to the beautiful redrock desert, encompassing 31 miles of trail and 8,000 feet of descent. Unfortunately, the top of the peak was still mostly frozen when we were in Moab, so we opted for the shorter, but equally awesome, Porcupine Rim Trail.

## Arches
No trip to Moab would be complete without a trip to the fantastic Arches National Park!
