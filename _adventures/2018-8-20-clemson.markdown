Clemson is situated in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains which contain a great amount of trails and lakes that are perfect for exploring. Joe Sherman, Clemson class of 1934, described Clemson in a much better way than I could ever imagine.
> My thoughts often wander through these upper South Carolina hills that shelter the University that forms a common bond for many thousands of people who have studied here, or taught here or worked here. There’s something in these hills that has touched every one of them, something that has rubbed off on them in varying degrees, something that has built within the breasts of all Clemson men and women an enduring spark akin to an eternal pride...There is something in these hills that you and I can’t define and others can’t understand. A wave of warmth always surges through me when “outsiders” say, “I don’t know what it is about you Clemson people, but your undying love for Clemson is admired by everyone I know.” There’s something in these hills and I suspect that’s what it is – the ability of an institution through the unending dedication and greatness of its people – its administration, its faculty, its staff, its students and alumni – to impart to all it touches a respect, an admiration, an affection that stands firm in disquieting times when things around it give impressions of coming unglued. Yes, there’s something in these hills where the Blue Ridge yawns its greatness. <cite><a href="https://alumni.clemson.edu/something-in-these-hills/">Joe Sherman</a></cite>
