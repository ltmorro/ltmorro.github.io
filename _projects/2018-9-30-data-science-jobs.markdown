This page is still a work in progress.

My Master's degree is quickly coming to an end, so now is the time to start my job search. It's my goal to find a position as a data scientist. *(Please hire me.)*

I had an idea that if I wanted to become a data scientist, I should find out what skills are most useful and desired in the field, and then work on my proficiency in those tools. That idea sprouted in to this project: mining data scientist job postings to find the most frequent required skills. I mined the job postings using Python libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. I created visualizations of the desired qualifications using `matplotlib`.
