Hi! Thanks for visiting! Welcome to my personal website!

My goal for this website is to create the amalgamation of everything I find interesting. From fascinating [applications][projects] of computer science to incredible displays of [mother nature][adventures], I hope to show you my view of this amazing world.  

From time to time, I hope to write some posts about little side projects I'm working on such as creating a raspberry pi garage door controller. I have no concrete plans, so this section will mostly be for fun.
